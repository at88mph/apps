known issues: 

"gradle clean build" fails because something done in the configuration phase gets wiped by the clean

build always unzips and signs the jnlp jar files

work around: do the clean and build as separate commands

Running integration tests requires:
- valid test certificates (in $A/test-certificates)
- valid servops.pem
- valid ca.crt file
